These are my questions in my interview app.

The reason I put these questions because this is a target interview and this is questions managers at target will ask. These questions are more personal and this is data for the manager to see if you fit the role at target. Also the reason the question "why do you wanna work at target is because to show how passionate your job being at target means to you and managers like that because the interviewer is recieveing that you want to work here.
