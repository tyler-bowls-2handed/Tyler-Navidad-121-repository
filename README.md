These are my questions in my interview app.

The reason I put these questions because the job thats being used in this app is more of an open job to show how diverse the person is and show knowledge about the real world. Its a little more of gettin some personal information about themselves and thats important because it can show that if you fit the role or not. So these questions is all about personal interests to match the responsibility of the job role they are interviewing on.
